## Dataset 

`dataset_UE_GTSNA.csv` (270 MB) encodes emails exchanged during the period 4 to 19 March 2019 in a consulting firm. 

The file has been compressed and splitted with `rar` in order to upload it to Moodle where files can't exceed 30 MB.

To extract the multi-part rars,   please use `unrar x dataset_UE_GTSNA.part01.rar` (Linux), or simply double-click (works also with Linux ;-))

1174928 lines in `dataset_UE_GTSNA.csv` 

Each line describes what a collaborator sent or received at MessDate. S/he sent (Id_Direction is equal to 1) or received an email from a contact (Id_Direction is equal to 2).

The interlocutor can be interne/externe/unidentified (PartnerTypeName).

The interaction involving the collaborator is defined by:

- GroupName1 : Post/Title of the collaborator

- RecipientName : The collaborator

- MessSize : message size in MÃ©gabytes

- MessDate : Date+Hour

- Id_Direction : 1 for a sent email, 2 for a received email

- PartnerTypeName : the interlocutor may be either: 

	- Interne
	- Internet (external interlocutor)
	- Unidentified local address (applications or server or cloud mail address)

- PartnerName : domain name if external interlocutor

- Recipient_Display : the interlocutor

### Mails

A line IS NOT an email, just the point of view of 1 **collaborator** from the **company**.

The dataset contains 509954 mails (uniques pairs ["Subject",'MessDate']). An email can be described by several lines.

 If Id_Direction = 2, Recipient_Display is the sender of the message and "ReciptientName" refers to the target. If Recipient_Display is not a colleague (PartnerTypeName = internet), the mail is described by 1 unique line : the point of view of the receiver. But if the sender is a colleague frome the company, there will be 2 lines for the same email : one line for the sender AND one line for the receiver.


Example1: if A and B are two internal colleagues, there will be 1 line dedicated to A and 1 line dedicated to B for the same message

Example2: if A, B, C are 3 colleagues and they all receive the same message from an external partner, there will be 3 lines with same (subject,date) with id_Direction = 2.
